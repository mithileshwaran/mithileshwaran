<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>A mobile phone, or cell phone,[a] is a portable telephone that allows users to make and receive
calls over a radio frequency link while moving within a designated telephone service area, unlike
fixed-location phones (landline phones). This radio frequency link connects to the switching
systems of a mobile phone operator, providing access to the public switched telephone network
(PSTN). Modern mobile telephony relies on a cellular network architecture, which is why mobile
phones are often referred to as 'cell phones' in North America.</p></body>
