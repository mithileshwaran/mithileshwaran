PASSPORT AUTOMATION SYSTEM
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop a Passport Automation System. The system developed should contain the following features:
1. Passport Automation System is used in the effective dispatch of passport to all of the applicants. This system adopts a comprehensive approach to minimize the manual work and schedule resources, time in a cogent manner.
2. The core of the system is to get the online registration form (with details such as name, address etc.,) filled by the applicant whose testament is verified for its genuineness by the Passport Automation System with respect to the already existing information in the database.
3. This forms the first and foremost step in the processing of passport application. After the first round of verification done by the system, the information is in turn forwarded to the regional administrator's (Ministry of External Affairs) office.
4. The application is then processed manually based on the report given by the system, and any forfeiting identified can make the applicant liable to penalty as per the law.
5. The system forwards the necessary details to the police for its separate verification whose report is then presented to the administrator. After all the necessary criteria have been met, the original information is added to the database and the passport is sent to the applicant.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
STOCK MAINTENANCE SYSTEM
INVENTORY SYSTEM is a real time application used in the merchant’s day to day system. This is a database to store the transaction that takes places between the Manufacturer, Dealer and the Shop Keeper that includes stock inward and stock outward with reference to the dealer. Here we assume our self as the Dealer and proceed with the transaction as follows:
The Manufacturer is the producer of the items and it contains the necessary information of the item such as price per item, Date of manufacture, best before use, Number of Item available and their Company name and address.
The Dealer is the secondary source of an Item and he purchases Item from the manufacturer by requesting the required Item with its corresponding Company Name and the Number of Items required. The Dealer is only responsible for distribution of the Item to the Retailers in the Town or City.
The Shop Keeper or Retailer is the one who is prime source for selling items in the market. The customers get Item from the Shop Keeper and not directly from the Manufacturer or the Dealer.
The Stock is the database used in our System which records all transactions that takes place between the Manufacturer and the Dealer and the Dealer and the Retailer.

ONLINE COURSE RESERVATION SYSTEM
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
 The course registration system will allow students to register for courses and view report cards from personal computers attached to the campus LAN as well as over the Internet. Professors will be able to access the system to sign up to teach courses as well as record grades.
 The legacy system performance is rather poor, so the new system must ensure that access course information from the legacy database but will not update it. The registrar’s office will continue to maintain course information through another system.
 At the beginning of each semester, students may request a course catalogue containing a list of course offerings for the semester. Information about each course, such as professor, department, and prerequisites, will be included to help students make informed decisions.
 The new system will allow students to select four courses offering for the coming semester. In addition, each student will indicate two alternatives choices in case the student cannot be assigned to a primary selection. Course offerings will have a maximum of ten students and a minimum of three students. A course offering with fewer than three students will be canceled. For each semester, there is period of time that the students can change their schedule. Students must be able to access the system during this time to add or drop courses. Once the registration process is completed for a student, the registration system sends information to the billing system so the student can be billed for the semester. If a course fills up during the actual registration process, the student must be notified of the change before submitting the schedule for processing.
 At the end of the semester, the student will be able to access the system to view an electronic report card. Since student grades are sensitive information, the system must employ extra security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
